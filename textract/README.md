# Amazon Textract

![screenshot of the demo application for using Textract](./textract.png)


This project was done to better familiarize myself with Amazon Textract - one of the AI services available in AWS. It uses the free tier of textract so there should be no charges (if you follow the guidelines for AWS free tier).

Textract scans documents for text, form's for key / value pairs, handworiting ananlysys,tabel data and even alows for queries such as 'what is the customers name on this invoice?'. You can also scan U.S. based ID's and has special services for handling Morgage data.

Notes: The textract api returns a JSON object with data pertaining to your search - in this case I sent it a picture I made in ms paint that says hello world!
